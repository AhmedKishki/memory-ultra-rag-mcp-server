"""A deterministic stand-in for the local model, so the suite needs no model.

A real embedder would make every test fetch 65 MB and would make an assertion
about *which* unit a query finds depend on a model's opinion. This one maps words
to hand-chosen directions, so a cosine is arithmetic: "manuscript" and "draft"
point the same way, "tea" does not, and anything unrecognised points a third way.
That is enough to prove the two sides work, the floor holds, and the labels are
honest, which is what these tests are for.
