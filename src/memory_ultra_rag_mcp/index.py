"""One scope's memory, as a table, and the rendering of it written on request.

``memory.sqlite3`` is the record. Every statement is a row in ``unit``: its text,
the kind it was filed under, its place in the document, and the four things a
sentence cannot hold — when it was added, how often it has been recalled, and
when it was last recalled. The same table is the FTS5 word index, so a statement
is stored once and found by words without a second copy to keep in step.

``MEMORY.md`` is an **export** of that record: the same statements as plain prose,
newest first, written when something asks for it — ``--export``, or the page on
every request — and never in passing. It exists to be read, diffed, and carried,
and it is not read as an input: a hand edit to it is disclosed rather than
adopted, and the statement it added is taken into the record instead.

The vectors are in the same file, keyed by the same statement digest, and are the
one derived part a rebuild cannot restore cheaply: they cost one embedding each.
A table whose shape this version does not write is dropped and rebuilt rather than
half-read.
