"""The vectors, in the same file as the index they answer for.

One SQLite file per scope holds three things, and the reason they share a file is
that they are all keyed by the same statement digest and read on the same answer:
the FTS5 word index, the vector of every statement, and a statement's history.
Keeping them together means one file to look at rather than three, one connection
per read rather than two, and one schema version rather than two.

What is still true of the parts: the word index is derived from the Markdown and
is re-read whenever the document changes, while the vectors and the history are
not derived from anything and survive that re-read. A file whose table is not the
shape this version writes is dropped and rebuilt rather than half-read, which is
also what retires the vectors of statements that have since been reworded.

The record is still the Markdown. This file holds nothing that a re-read of the
document cannot restore except those two, and a statement is never in this file's
power to lose.
