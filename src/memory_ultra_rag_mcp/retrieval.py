"""What a read is allowed to do, in one object.

Retrieval has levers — a model, a floor, two weights, a depth, a reranker — and
every one of them is a decision someone could argue about. They live here, in one
frozen object read from one place, so the later measurement can sweep them
without a single call site changing, and so a reader can see the whole shape of
a lookup in one screen.

The defaults are the collection's measured ones rather than invented numbers:
weighted reciprocal rank fusion with ``rrf_k = 60``, BM25 weighted 1.25 against
dense 1.0, a cosine floor of 0.72, and a relative margin of 0.10 around the
query's best candidate. They are the sibling server's, measured on a document
corpus rather than on memory units, and what decides whether they hold here is a
measurement this package has not yet made. Reranking is on, because a memory's
units are one line each, which is where a bi-encoder is weakest, and a
cross-encoder reads the pair rather than either side alone; its cost is bounded
by ``rerank_depth`` against the read's ceiling. That it is more *accurate* here
is unmeasured, and nothing in this package claims it.
