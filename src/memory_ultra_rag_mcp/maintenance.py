"""Keeping the derived state in step with the record, on the write side.

Three rules, in the order they happen:

1. **Durability first.** The statement is a row in the record before anything here
   runs, so nothing in this module can lose a memory.
2. **No work proportional to the memory.** What is asked about is which statements
   the vector table is missing, which is a set difference over keys rather than a
   pass over the memory.
3. **A write never fails because of the lookup layer.** If the model is
   unavailable the units are left pending, the write says so, and the next write
   or an explicit reindex picks them up.

This is also where the deliberate trade is made explicit. Maintaining the index
here rather than on the read path is what keeps a lookup O(1) in the number of
statements; the cost is that the vector side trails a write whose model was not
available, and a read reports that it is behind rather than pretending otherwise.
:func:`reindex` exists for that.
