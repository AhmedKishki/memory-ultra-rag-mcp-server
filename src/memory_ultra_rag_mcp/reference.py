"""The UltraRAG revision this server's memory behaviour is taken from.

Nothing here is configurable. The two memory kinds this server serves follow one
behaviour — a standing document plus dated rounds, written in a fixed format — and
this module records which upstream revision that behaviour and those formats were
taken from, so a change to either is a deliberate change to this file.
