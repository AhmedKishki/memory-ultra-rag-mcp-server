"""Every tunable this server reads, as one registry over a shared layer stack.

The settings are declared in a table here and shipped as ``default.toml`` beside
this module, so a value that exists in code and a value a file may set cannot
drift apart: a layer may only set a key this registry declares, and a key the
registry does not declare is an error rather than a silent default.

The layers, lowest precedence first:

1. the packaged ``default.toml``, which holds every setting;
2. the user's ``config.toml``, in the account's config directory — the one that
   applies globally, since a memory is shared by every project on the account;
3. the project's own ``config.toml``, inside the project's own state, for a
   project that wants to differ from the account;
4. a file named with ``--config``;
5. ``MEMORY_ULTRARAG_*`` environment variables, one declared per setting;
6. ``--set key=value`` on the command line.

Each layer names only the keys it changes, and every effective value reports the
layer that supplied it, so ``--print-config`` can say where a number came from
rather than only what it is.

The stack itself, the registry's ``Setting`` type, the coercion every layer
shares, the provenance, and the three path helpers live in the separately
versioned ``config-ultra-rag-mcp`` library, pinned by commit. What is left here
is this server's own vocabulary: the keys, their types and bounds, the packaged
default, and the effective settings the code reads.
