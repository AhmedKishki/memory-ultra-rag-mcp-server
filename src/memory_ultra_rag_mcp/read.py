"""Answering one read: words, meaning, and only what matched.

This is the blocking path, so it is the one place where the cost rules are
strict. A read embeds its query once, scans the scope's vectors once, queries
the lexical index once, fuses the two sides, and returns. It does not walk the
scope's files, it does not embed anything but the query, and it does not load a
model: a lookup that has to wait for a load is a lookup that stalls its caller,
and the model is loaded on the serving side instead.

Three properties are decisions rather than details:

* **Both sides answer, and the answer says which.** A dense side alone is the
  weakest mode in the collection's own measurements, and its worst class is
  proper nouns, which is most of what a memory holds; a word side alone cannot
  find a statement that never used the caller's words. So a unit may arrive by
  words, by meaning, or by both, and it is labelled.
* **Nothing below the floor is admitted.** Without a floor a dense side always
  answers, always with the nearest thing it has, and always answering is worse
  than declining. A unit within the relative margin of the query's own best is
  the one exception, so a single strong match is not discarded with the rest.
* **New information wins a tie, and only a tie.** The document is ordered newest
  first, so a statement's position says when it was recorded, and a statement that
  matched equally well and was recorded later is the better answer. The
  preference is a small bonus on the fused score and nothing more: it breaks ties
  and can never lift a weaker match over a better one.
* **A read reports what it could not do.** If the model is not resident, the
  answer says the semantic side was unavailable rather than quietly returning a
  worse result that looks like the same one. If the index may be behind because
  a file was edited in place, it says that too, and names the command that
  fixes it.
