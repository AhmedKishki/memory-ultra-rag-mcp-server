"""The document beside the record, and the words of a statement.

The record is the table in ``memory.sqlite3``; this module is the file written out
from it, and the two shapes a statement takes on the way: a row, and a block of
prose.

**The document is gone; what is here renders one.** The record is a table, and a
table is the memory: one row per statement, holding its words, its kind, its place,
when it was added, and how often it has been recalled. There is no file beside it,
because a second copy of the same statements is a second thing to keep in step and
one of them is eventually wrong.

What survives of a file is the shape. ``render_document`` turns a record into the
prose a person reads — which is what the browser view shows, and what a caller
could be shown — and ``parse_document`` turns that prose back into statements,
which is how the page saves an edit and how a memory of an older version is
recovered. A document left by an earlier version is read once, for anything the
record lacks, and then removed; that is what ``index.retire_superseded`` does, and
it is the only path that reads a file.

**A statement is one line of prose, and its type is a row, not a prefix.** Upstream
never writes a statement, so the block format is this package's; the file it seeds
with is upstream's, byte for byte. The type used to be written into the block as a
``RULE: `` prefix, and it is not any more: a file of tagged lines reads as data
rather than as something a person wrote, and a type is a property of the row that
holds the statement. A statement imported from a file that still has the prefix
keeps the type it had there, and the next export drops the prefix.
